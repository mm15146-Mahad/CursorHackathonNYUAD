# CursorHackathonNYUAD

This github was created during the 2025 Violet Ventures Cursor Startup Hackathon. Here is our project proposal:

EverSave is an app that helps users create healthy saving and spending habits. It does this by gamifying the process, such as letting users see how much money they have saved based on how high they are on a mountain.
